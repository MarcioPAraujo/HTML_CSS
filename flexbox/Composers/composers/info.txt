Career:
	He has begun study with his father, who pushed him for hard work, that was a harsh time for the young Beethoven, later he was studying with Christian Gottlob Neefe, who helped him in his first composition. At 21 he moved to Vienna where he could study with Haydn, and gained reputation of a piano virtuoso and make his Opus 1 (three piano trios) which was dedicated to Prince Lichnowsky in 1795. As he was becoming more recognized, he gained some students such the countess Julies Giucciardi whose fell in love, but due to class diference he couldn't pursuit it, then dedicated in 1802 the Sonat Op.27 No.2 (Moonlight Sonnata), one of his most popular work, to her. His brother started managing business dealings with publishers in 1802 nogotiating highter prices for recent works.
	For a few months he'd been outside of Vienna by medical advice to treat his deafness, although he could still hear but not quite well. When he returned to Vienna stated the "Heroic Period", when he intend to innovate, and compose some of the well-known works done like the Third Symphony in E-flat Op. 55 (Eroica), written in 1803-1804 and his Piano Concerto No.5 (Emperor).
	Between 1815 and 1819 Beethoven didn't produce much, since he was suffering with a "inflammatory fever" as he called it, even though there is a suggestion that this wasn't the only reason, it's also consequence of legal problems involving his nephew Karl. In this fase his audition has drecrease even more, making him to write several things in notebooks, which helped to document some things about him.
